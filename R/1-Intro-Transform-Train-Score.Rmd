This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

This cell connects R to Spark
```{r}
if (file.exists("/dbfs")) {
  library(SparkR)
  library(sparklyr)
  sparkR.session()
  sc <- spark_connect(method = "databricks")
} else {
  library(sparklyr)
  spark_install()
  sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

First, we will copy the mtcars dataset into Spark.
```{r}
mtcars_tbl <- copy_to(sc, mtcars, "mtcars")
```

Transform the data with Spark SQL, feature transformers, and DataFrame functions.

Use Spark SQL to remove all cars with horsepower less than 100
Use Spark feature transformers to bucket cars into two groups based on cylinders
Use Spark DataFrame functions to partition the data into test and training
Then fit a linear model using spark ML. Model MPG as a function of weight and cylinders.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# transform our data set, and then partition into 'training', 'test'
partitions <- mtcars_tbl %>%
  filter(hp >= 100) %>%
  ft_bucketizer("cyl", "cyl8", splits = c(0, 8, 12)) %>%
  sdf_random_split(training = 0.5, test = 0.5, seed = 888)

# fit a linear mdoel to the training dataset
fit <- partitions$training %>%
  ml_linear_regression(mpg ~ wt + cyl8)

summary(fit)
```

```{r}
# Score the data
pred <- ml_predict(fit, partitions$test) %>%
  collect

library(ggplot2)

# Plot the predicted versus actual mpg
ggplot(pred, aes(x = mpg, y = prediction)) +
  geom_abline(lty = "dashed", col = "red") +
  geom_point() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Actual Fuel Consumption",
    y = "Predicted Fuel Consumption",
    title = "Predicted vs. Actual Fuel Consumption"
  )
```
