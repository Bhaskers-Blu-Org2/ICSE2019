John Mark Agosta leads a team that is expanding the machine learning and 
artificial intelligence capabilities of Microsoft Azure. He recently
joined Microsoft, which if he were smarter, he should have done earlier
in his career -- a career that involved working with startups and labs
in the Bay Area, in such areas as "The Connected Car 2025" at _Toyota ITC_, 
sales opportunity scoring at _Inside Sales_, malware detection at _Intel_, 
and automated planning at_ SRI_. At Intel Labs, he was awarded a _Santa Fe
Institute_ Business Fellowship in 2007. He has over 30 peer-reviewed
publications and 6 accepted patents.  His dedication to probability and
its applications is shown by his participation in the annual
_Uncertainty in AI_ conference since its inception in 1985. When feeling 
low he recharges his spirits by singing Russian music with _Slavyanka_,
the Bay Area's Slavic music chorus.
